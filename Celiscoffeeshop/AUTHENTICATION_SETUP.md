## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/App.tsx`**
   - Wrapped `/contact` and `/order` routes with `<ProtectedRoute>`
   - Routes now check authentication before rendering

2. **`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`**
   - Updated to redirect to `/login` instead of `/register`
   - Checks `localStorage` for user session
   - Returns `<Navigate to="/login" />` if not authenticated

### Authentication Check:
```typescript
const isAuthenticated = (): boolean => {
  const user = localStorage.getItem('user');
  return !!user;
};
```
